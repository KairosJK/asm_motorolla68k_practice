# Motorolla 68k practice programs

Simple test programs made in the 68k assembly language written using the [EASY68k](http://www.easy68k.com/) editor. Much credit given to the documentation for some of the opcodes and 68k topics on [68k.hax.com](http://68k.hax.com/).

All of the programs rely on the editor to be used, and would require tweaking to be used on actual hardware.
